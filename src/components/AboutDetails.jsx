                <p className='text-[1.2rem]'>
                    My journey into the world of technology began with a curiosity for how things work under the hood. From tinkering with code to building full-fledged applications, I've grown into a developer who thrives on solving complex problems and bringing innovative ideas to life. Over the years, I've honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, among other technologies.
